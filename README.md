# Wikipedia article analyzer

##Installation
Drop the code in htdocs.. 

##Usage
The application sorts the first 50 articles in a wiki category in order of readability.

Example Usage:
http://localhost/app/api/api.php?category=Category:Physics

The return is a json object that contains sorted data, for example:

```
